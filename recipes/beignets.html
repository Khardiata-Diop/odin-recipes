    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beignets (pronounced ben-yays) are the official state doughnut of Louisiana.
        These pillowy, deep-fried squares of yeasted dough are served piping hot
        and buried under a small mountain of powdered sugar. Unlike traditional
        doughnuts, they have no hole and are slightly more bread-like, making
        them the perfect companion to a cup of café au lait. They are a symbol
        of New Orleans' French heritage and the legendary Café du Monde.Beignets

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             
    <ul>
        <li>The Dough :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 ¼ tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>6 ½ to 7 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Frying & Finishing :</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable or Peanut oil (for deep frying)</li>
            <li>2 cups powdered sugar (for dusting)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
          
    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bloom the Yeast : In a large bowl, whisk together warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Mix the Wet Ingredients : Whisk in the beaten egg, evaporated milk, salt, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Form the Dough : Gradually add 4 cups of flour, mixing until smooth. Switch to a dough hook (or use your hands) and add the remaining flour until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Rise : Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1–2 hours (or refrigerate overnight for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Cut : Roll the dough out on a floured surface to about ¼-inch thickness. Cut into 2-inch squares or rectangles.</li>
        <li>Fry : Heat oil in a deep pot to 360°F (182°C). Fry the dough in batches (3–4 at a time). They will puff up instantly. Flip them once they are golden brown (about 1 minute per side).</li>
        <li>Sugar : Drain briefly on paper towels, then immediately toss them into a bag or bowl filled with powdered sugar while still hot. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
