    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thieboudieun (pronounced che-boo-jen), or Ceebu Jën, is the crown jewel of Senegalese cuisine.
    It is widely considered the national dish of Senegal and the original inspiration for West African
    Jollof rice. It's name literally translates from the Wolof language to "Rice with Fish". Born in
    the 19th-century coastal city of Saint-Louis, legend credits the dish to a famous cook named Penda Mbaye,
    who substituted rice for barley during a shortage.[2][4] Unlike other Jollof variations, Thieboudienne
    is a complex, one-pot masterpiece featuring firm white fish stuffed with a vibrant herb marinade (nokoss),
    simmered with an array of root vegetables in a rich tomato broth. The highlight is the broken jasmine rice,
    which absorbs the intense flavors of the fish and fermented seasonings, resulting in a dish that is savory,
    slightly tangy, and deeply aromatic. It is traditionally served on a large communal platter,
    symbolizing Teranga (Senegalese hospitality).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Stuff the Fish Prepare the nokoss by blending or pounding the parsley, garlic, peppers, and spices into a thick paste.
        Use a knife to cut deep slits into the fish steaks and stuff them generously with the paste. Let the fish marinate
        for at least 30 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Fry and Sear Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot (a Dutch oven is ideal). Fry the fish pieces until golden
        brown on both sides. Remove the fish and set aside. (In some variations, the fish is simmered rather than fried;
        both are delicious).</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Build the Sauce In the same oil, sauté the chopped onions until translucent. Add the tomato paste and fry for
        5–8 minutes, stirring constantly until it turns a deep dark red. Add the pureed tomatoes, nététou, and guedj if using.
        Pour in the water/stock and bring to a boil.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Simmer the Vegetables Add the harder vegetables first (cassava, carrots) followed by the cabbage, eggplant,
        and sweet potato. Let them simmer in the red broth for about 20–25 minutes. Once tender, carefully remove
        the vegetables and the fish (if you added it back in) and place them on a tray. Keep them warm.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Cook the Rice Wash the broken rice several times until the water runs clear. Drain well. Taste your broth—it
        should be highly seasoned and slightly salty (the rice will absorb this). If there is too much liquid,
        remove some (you want about 1 inch of broth above the rice). Add the rice to the pot, cover tightly,
        and cook on low heat for 20–25 minutes until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p> Plating (The Reveal) Fluff the rice and spread it onto a large serving platter. Arrange the cooked fish
        in the center and decorate the perimeter with the vibrant vegetables. Serve with lime wedges and an extra
        side of spicy nokoss if desired.</p>
